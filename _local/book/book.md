# Reinhold Niebuhr


Reinhold Niebuhr was a German theologian that passed away in 19XX.  You may not have ever seen or heard his name, but I promise you that you know his work.  In 19XX he wrote  the Serentity Prayer:  God grant me the serenity to accpe the things I cannot alter, the courage to alter the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.  The Serenity Prayer is almost synonymous with the 12 step program Alcoholics Anonymous, but Niebuhr, by most accounts, did not have a problem with alcohol.  Niebuhr wrote The Serenity Prayer watching the rise of Hitler and the Nazi's in his homeland.  '

# What is autocratic despair
Autocratic Despair is the feeling of hopelessness & powerlessness that arises when living under or dealing with an autocratic regime or leadership. In a nascent Authoritarian state, it assaults the senses in any way it can at an accelerated pace.  It is by design.  The idea is to implant the idea that there is one individual or small group that holds absolute power. It is meant to exhaust the people it oppresses, to create a sense of hopelessness that causes them to believe there isn't anything that can be done and withdraw into a pervasive sense of despair, frustration, and anxiety.

Think of the emotional & psychological trauma that has been inflicted on us since the orange man descended from his golden escalator in 2015.

impact that has


This term captures the emotional and psychological impact of being subjected to a system where one individual or a small group holds absolute power, making decisions without consulting others and often suppressing dissent.

In such environments, individuals may feel their voices are unheard, their freedoms are restricted, and their ability to influence change is severely limited. This can lead to a pervasive sense of despair, frustration, and anxiety12.
