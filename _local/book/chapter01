# About Donald Tr*mp
Where possible, I've gone out of my way not to mention Donald Tr*mp by name in this book. Where I have found it necessary, I've omitted letters from the name and replaced them with a wildcard character.

I have some incredibly strong feelings about the man. As a President I find him abhorrent, but as a Historical figure I find him an incredibly important–perhaps the most important–figure in US History.

I do not blame anyone for becoming enthralled with the man. Even as I find him repulsive, I cannot look away when he speaks. He's an incredible villain: a compelling character.

There are moments where I feel jealous of MAGA enthusiasts: I'd like to believe in anyone as much as they believe in Tr*mp. Were it anyone else, I could've gotten on board with a dynamic Billionaire setting his fortune aside and running for President to rescue the country from the status-quo.

I recognize that the premise of the book alone is enough to alienate hardcore MAGA Enthusiasts, but I do want to create some space for the many supporters  that have found & will find themselves disillusioned. It’s the True Believers - after all - that will be the most betrayed.

# The Intended Audience
Since 2015, I've paid a disproportionate amount of attention to Presidential politics in the United States. Few things I've experienced in life have been this fascinating.


My goal in writing this book was to distill some of this knowledge into bite-size pieces that people who do not typically read many books would find palatable.  Something a reader could pick up and put down in 5 to 10 minute increments while their tablet is charging. Something you could look at while you are sitting on the toilet

--- # Anecdote
Claire scrolls through her social media feed, a mix of vacation photos, political memes, and cute animal videos. Nothing out of the ordinary, except for one thing: every few posts, there was a government-sponsored message praising the new policies, the strong leadership, the growing national pride. A subtle shift in tone. A gentle nudge towards a singular narrative.

She clicks on an article about a recent protest on her campus. The headline proclaims "Disgruntled Few Disrupt National Unity." Claire witnessed the protest on her way to class – a diverse crowd of college students that seemed energetic but peaceful, understated if anything. Yet the article paints the protesters as outliers threatening the harmonious society that was building. Her fellow students are now troublemakers.

A wave of unease washes over her. Claire considers herself politically apathetic, but reasonably aware.  Something feels off. She searches for other news sources, but a couple of the websites she visits are now blocked, replaced with error messages citing "national security concerns."

At her book club meeting later in the week, Claire brings up the protest. The room falls silent. A few members try to change the subject. Two others offer lukewarm agreement with the government's stance. One woman, usually outspoken, just shrugs, her eyes downcast. "It's not worth getting into," she murmurs.

Claire leaves the meeting feeling strange. Disconnected. People seem like they are playing along with a new set of rules, a subtle shift in the collective reality. The alternative viewpoints she values from the other book club members - typically in no short supply - were absent. Replaced with a veneer of manufactured consensus.

This is "unreality" creeping in – a slow, insidious distortion of the truth, the implied pressure to conform. Not the blatant oppression of a full-blown autocracy, just doubt about what sort of conversations are OK to have in public. The early stages of a gradual normalization of alternate reality, where questioning the narrative is not merely inconvenient but potentially dangerous.

Claire's experience highlights how "unreality" can take root in the mundane aspects of everyday life. It's in the creeping suspicion that things aren't as they seem.  It's in the subtle self-censorship that starts to take hold. It's the unsettling feeling of living in a world where truth is malleable, and disagreement is some sort of transgression.


# Situations that are personal that would make a person reluctant to engage for fear of encountering MAGA

##### These experiences, though seemingly small, contribute to a sense of unease and a growing reluctance to engage with the world. The constant fear of encountering divisive and harmful ideologies creates a feeling of isolation and erodes the sense of community that is essential for a healthy society.

1. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">The Coffee Shop Encounter***: I was at my favorite local coffee shop, a place I used to find solace. A new face sat at the communal table, and we exchanged pleasantries. The conversation drifted towards current events, and they began to express views that were not only politically different from mine, but also rooted in conspiracy theories and aggressive rhetoric. I felt a knot of anxiety tighten in my stomach. What was once a place of relaxation now felt like a potential minefield. I found myself cutting the conversation short, making a hasty exit, and wondering if I'd ever feel comfortable in that space again.

2. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">The Neighborhood Gathering***: Our neighborhood association organized a summer barbecue, a tradition meant to foster community spirit. I was excited to connect with neighbors I didn't know well. But as the evening progressed, I overheard a conversation about "stolen elections" and "deep state" conspiracies. The tone was sharp, the words laced with anger. I recognized the familiar patterns of misinformation and divisive rhetoric. I retreated to a quiet corner, feeling a sense of isolation in my own neighborhood, a place that should have felt like a safe haven.

3. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">The Online Forum:*** I joined an online forum for a hobby I enjoy, hoping to connect with like-minded individuals. A seemingly innocuous thread quickly devolved into a debate about political ideologies. I was shocked by the aggressive language and personal attacks used by some participants. The forum, once a source of enjoyment, now felt like a toxic environment. I logged off, feeling a sense of weariness and a reluctance to engage in online communities anymore.

4. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">The Family Dinner***: During a family dinner, a relative I rarely see began to express increasingly extreme political views. What started as a casual discussion turned into a heated argument. The dinner was ruined, and the atmosphere was thick with tension. I left feeling a sense of grief and a deep concern for the future of our family relationships. It made me dread future gatherings, wondering if every interaction would now be a potential battleground.

5. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">Child's School Event:*** I hesitated to attend my child's school play, knowing some parents held extreme views. The fear of an uncomfortable confrontation outweighed my desire to support my child.

6. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">The Public Library:*** I stopped browsing the library's community bulletin board, once a source of local events, due to the increasing number of extremist flyers.

7. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">The Local Farmers Market:*** What was once a pleasant weekend outing became a source of anxiety, as I overheard vendors spreading conspiracy theories.

8. ***<span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.25em;">The Gym:*** I changed gyms, as the one I frequented had an uptick in members wearing red Make America Great Again hats and "we the people" or "1776" t-shirts or tattoos. I asked the people n the locker room  became a breeding ground for political arguments and aggressive rhetoric.

9. ***The Volunteer Opportunity:*** I declined an invitation to volunteer at a local charity, concerned about the political leanings of the organizers.
10. ***The Concert:*** I sold my ticket to a concert, worried about encountering hostile individuals in the crowd.
11. ***The Art Gallery Opening:*** I skipped an art gallery opening, fearing it would be a platform for political grandstanding.
12. ***The Hiking Trail:*** I avoided popular hiking trails, concerned about encountering individuals displaying extremist symbols.
13. ***The Book Club:*** I left a book club, as it became a forum for political debates rather than literary discussions.
14. ***The Neighborhood Watch Meeting:*** I stopped attending neighborhood watch meetings, as they were increasingly dominated by conspiracy theories.
15. ***The Community Garden:*** I withdrew from a community garden project, due to the presence of individuals with aggressive political views.
16. ***The Online Gaming Community:*** I left an online gaming community, as it became a breeding ground for hateful rhetoric.
17. ***The Local Theater:*** I stopped attending local theater productions, worried about encountering hostile individuals in the audience.
18. ***The Town Hall Meeting:*** I avoided attending town hall meetings, as they were increasingly dominated by political arguments and misinformation.
19. ***The College Reunion:*** I declined to attend my college reunion, fearing uncomfortable political discussions with former classmates.
20. ***The Religious Service:*** I changed religious congregations, as my previous one became increasingly politicized.
21. ***The Local Park:*** I avoided visiting local parks during peak hours, concerned about encountering individuals displaying extremist symbols.
22. ***The Commute:*** I changed my daily commute to avoid areas where political protests were frequent.
23. ***The Social Gathering:*** I limited my attendance at social gatherings, fearing they would become platforms for political debates.
24. ***The Casual Conversation:*** I became hesitant to engage in casual conversations with strangers, fearing they would quickly turn political.

    - examples
  - What it's purpose is in terms of the larger plan
  - What it will do to you if left unrecognized & unchecked
    - Ultimately, you become reactive or completely withdrawn
  - Why it is important to not let it diminish you'
  - What the mindset needs oto be for a reader to get the most out of the book.

The Trump era has torn a hole in the very fabric of reality

Autocratic Despair is the fear, anxiety, & helplessness a population feels when a Democracy descends into Authoritarianism.




# What is Autocratic Despair
Autocratic Despair is the feeling of hopelessness & powerlessness that arises when living under an autocratic regime or leadership.


Take a look around:
Are you appalled that the meanest people have become the loudest?
Do you dread meeting new people because they might be among the population that exists in a different reality?
Do you feel frustrated that someone that is clearly a threat to this country has been elevated to the highest status by your fellow citizens?



That's Autocratic Despair.

The fact is that there is a good portion of our population that isn't adhering to the Social Contract, but still expect to benefit from the protections it conveys. People who demand civility even as they dispatch cruelty.  People who go out of their way to vice signal. These individuals don't seem to be any worse off than the rest of us, despite how they act. You have to deal with them on a daily basis.

## Autocratic Despair is Exhausting
The cumulative effect of all of this is mass Trauma.  To constantly have to bear witness to this intentional infliction of trauma is generating widespread anxiety & depression on a national scale.  It's driving people apart.



# Why is Autocratic Despair so awful?

1. Uncertainty




# Uncertainty
Human beings flourish in an environtment where they have a sense that if they say or do a certain thing, the results of doing so will result in the same thing each & every time. In an Authoritarian regime, there is little that you can count on but uncertainty.

Uncertainty - particularly prolonged uncertainty - will have the effect of an increase in new mental health issues for many people and a worsening of symptoms in those with existing conditions.  As cultural norms change political instability in our country will erode trust in general and that will lead to a loss of identity as fear & alienation become commonplace emotions.

In uncertain times, people won't know what - or whom - to believe.  Decision-making and pattern recognition will erode and it will become much more difficult to tell fact from fiction.  This chronic stress will start to rewire more & more brains all the whole increasing their vulnerability to anxiety and depression.

There are other countries that have descended into Autocracies.  What they have in common is a sharp uptick in new mental health diagnoses for citizens with no previous mental health issues and increased symptoms for those with previously existing conditions.

You are not immune. Your ability to recognize these things as they begin to take their toll on you and the people you love is the most important thing to determine whether you will succomb to Autocratic Despair or rise above it.







You'll often find yourself asking the question in the near future: Is the root of all this darkness a willfully ignorant and easily misinformed Citizenry or is it due to corrupt & Kleptocratic government officials?

Anxiety about the future grinds on you.  It causes a pervasive sense of fear & hopelessness.

As we move forward, it is important to remember that what we lose, we don't necessarily have to go back to.  In many cases we will want to rush back to what is familiar.  We'll have a nostalgia for how things were before this madness. For whatever faults it may have had - it certainly wasn't as bad as this is.  It is worth remembering that whatever the advantages of the past were, it still delivered us to the place we find ourselves in right now.



This isn't an isolated phenomenon. It has happened throughout history whenever an Authoritarian regime has tried to root themselves into power.  It's meant to divide us.  It's meant to make us think the unreality that they've created is the only one that exists.  It's meant to make you think that things will get worse if you don't stay quiet. It's meant to diminish the quality of your life if you refuse to get on board. It's meant to make you avert your glance as they aim violence at US Citizens. It's meant to make sure you withdraw from public life, lest you become the next victim. It's meant to demoralize us into becoming compliant.

## If you will change, then the whole world will change - for you
The point of this book is that you are going to have to live through this - you don't have much of a choice.  Where you do have a choice is to decide who you are going to be once this subsides.


---
## This is by Design

The result they are hoping for is that you either become so withdrawn that you become passive or so predictably obsessed that you'll react reflexively to their provocations. It's a conspiracy happening in plain view.  It's a psyop. It is supposed to feel overwhelming.

#  1. Face Reality Head On - to the Extent that You Can
The Descent of our Democracy into Authoritarianism is a painful thing to acknowledge.  As human beings, we're programmed to avoid pain.  There is no


# The things that we do to avoid pain.
1. Avoidance - Denial
2. Deny
3. Suppress
4. Become Numb
5. Go to Sleep
6. Reject

Monitor what can be monitored - at least on a weekly basis.  What do you weigh?  How much money is in your checking account?

You are your own single source of truth.  Do you know where your birth certificate is? Your social security card? Your marriage certificate? The deed to your house?  Your high school diploma?

Now is the time to gather these things and place them somewhere safe and preferably behind a lock & key. There are fireproof lockboxes available for you to store the information in a convenient place. Do not rely on digitized copies - they are nice to have, but you need to make sure you have a physical copy of them all.

## The MAGA Enthusiast
I run into people every single day that wrap their entire identity up in their preferred political candidate. There was a time when you could only hazard an educated guess at a stranger's political proclivities, but now people announce it with their red hats, vulgar t-shirts & open disdain for most people not similarly attired. Seems weird


In a nascent Authoritarian state, it assaults the senses in any way it can at an accelerated pace.  It is by design.  The idea is to implant the idea that there is one individual or small group that holds absolute power. It is meant to exhaust the people it oppresses, to create a sense of hopelessness that causes them to believe there isn't anything that can be done and withdraw into a pervasive sense of despair, frustration, and anxiety.

Think of the emotional & psychological trauma that has been inflicted on us since the orange man descended from his golden escalator in 2015.

impact that has



In such environments, individuals may feel their voices are unheard, their freedoms are restricted, and their ability to influence change is severely limited. This can lead to a pervasive sense of despair, frustration, and anxiety12.

That feeling of incredible frustration over the way our most ignorant & obstinate neighbors have gleefully brought about an era where nothing truly matters.  The shock at how gleeful people we know well enough to feel comfortable telling us that this is a completely legitimate way to live because the alternative was a woman of color who would've for certain done a worse job.

    * Undermining the rule of law and weakening independent institutions, such as the judiciary, creates a sense of lawlessness.
    * The manipulation of elections, and the destruction of free and fair elections, leads to citizens feeling as though their voice does not matter.

* **Forced Nationalism in Education & News**
    * The constant pushing of a state sponsored ideology, that does not match the reality of the citizens lives, creates deep resentment.

* **Erasure of History**
    * The rewriting of history, to fit the current regimes narrative, causes distrust in the information that the government provides.

## ***4. Isolation and Psychological Warfare:***

    * This allows the regime to justify repressive measures and maintain control.

    * This creates a sense of unreality, and erodes the ability of citizens to trust their own senses.

* **Trolls and bots at scale:**

# Unreality in Autocratic Regimes
The concept of "unreality" in the context of fascism, as discussed by scholars like Jason Stanley, refers to the deliberate erosion of the foundations of objective truth. It's a tactic used to manipulate and control populations. Here's a breakdown of what that entails:

**Key Aspects of "Unreality" in Fascism:**

* **Destruction of Shared Reality:**
    * Fascist politics aims to dismantle the ability of people to agree on basic facts.
    * This is achieved through the constant dissemination of lies, propaganda, and conspiracy theories.
* **Erosion of Trust in Institutions:**
    * Attacks on the media, educational institutions, and the judicial system undermine public trust in these sources of reliable information.
    * This creates a vacuum where the fascist leader or regime becomes the sole arbiter of truth.
* **Promotion of Conspiracy Theories:**
    * Conspiracy theories are used to create an "us vs. them" mentality, demonizing perceived enemies and justifying extreme actions.
    * These theories often exploit existing anxieties and prejudices.
* **Replacement of Reason with Emotion:**
    * Fascist propaganda appeals to emotions like fear, anger, and resentment, rather than relying on rational arguments.
    * This allows the regime to bypass critical thinking and manipulate public opinion.
* **Creation of an Alternative Reality:**
    * The regime constructs a distorted version of reality that serves its interests, where its actions are always justified and its enemies are always to blame.

**In essence:**

* "Unreality" is a tool to destabilize society, making it easier for an authoritarian regime to maintain control.
* By blurring the lines between truth and falsehood, fascism seeks to create a state where anything is possible, and the regime's power is absolute.

This is a very important concept to understand, as it is a key component of how fascist movements gain and retain power.
